I/flutter ( 2698): Erro ao processar toque no marcador: Error: Could not find the correct Provider<RouteProvider> above this MapWidget Widget
I/flutter ( 2698): 
I/flutter ( 2698): This happens because you used a `BuildContext` that does not include the provider
I/flutter ( 2698): of your choice. There are a few common scenarios:
I/flutter ( 2698): 
I/flutter ( 2698): - You added a new provider in your `main.dart` and performed a hot-reload.
I/flutter ( 2698):   To fix, perform a hot-restart.
I/flutter ( 2698): 
I/flutter ( 2698): - The provider you are trying to read is in a different route.
I/flutter ( 2698): 
I/flutter ( 2698):   Providers are "scoped". So if you insert of provider inside a route, then
I/flutter ( 2698):   other routes will not be able to access that provider.
I/flutter ( 2698): 
I/flutter ( 2698): - You used a `BuildContext` that is an ancestor of the provider you are trying to read.
I/flutter ( 2698): 
I/flutter ( 2698):   Make sure that MapWidget is under your MultiProvider/Provider<RouteProvider>.
I/flutter ( 2698):   This usually happens when you are creating a provider and trying to read it immediately.
I/flutter ( 2698): 
I/flutter ( 2698):   For example, instead of:
I/flutter ( 2698): 
I/flutter ( 2698):   ```
I/flutter ( 2698):   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
I/flutter ( 2698):     return Provider<Example>(
I/flutter ( 2698):       create: (_) => Example(),
I/flutter ( 2698):       // Will throw a ProviderNotFoundError, because `context`
